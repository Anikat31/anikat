### I am [Anikat Kankaria](https://www.icts.res.in/people/anikat-kankaria), currently I am a research scholar at TIFR-ICTS, Bengaluru. I am wokring with [Prof. Samriddhi Sankar Ray](https://www.icts.res.in/people/samriddhi-sankar-ray). <br>

 My interest lies in far from equillibrium phenomena namely, turbulence. Futher I am interested in dynamical-systems and other aspects of non-equillibrium physics like, ecology-evolution, networks, modeling and understanding the stochastic nature of financial markets,  random-walks, mathematical aspects of turbulence. <br>
 Apart from academia I am interested in playing sports like badminton, Table Tennis, swimming and Squash. I also love learning different languages be it human languages or programming language. Currently, in leisure time I am trying to learn harmonica and develop my teaching skills. Finally, I reall like listening to music, I don't have any particular preference in terms of genre or anything.
